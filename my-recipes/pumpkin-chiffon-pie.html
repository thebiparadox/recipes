        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>For those of us who don't like how dense traditional pumpkin pie can be, this chiffon pie is light and airy. Perfect for dessert after a large holiday meal.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h3>Crust</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>12 graham crackers</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons of granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon of kosher salt</li>
                    <li>6 tablespoons of unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Filling and Assembly</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 envelope of unflavored gelatin (2 1/2 teaspoons)</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon of all-spice</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar, divided</li>
                    <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup whole milk</li>
                    <li>1 1/4 cup pumpkin puree</li>
                    <li>3 large egg whites</li>
                    <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.</li>
                    <li>Pulse graham crackers in a food processor until broken down into fine crumbs (you should have about 2 cups). Set aside 2 Tbsp. graham cracker crumbs for serving. Add sugar and salt and pulse just to combine. Add butter and pulse until mixture is the consistency of wet sand.</li>
                    <li>Transfer to a 9½"-diameter deep pie dish. Using a measuring cup, press crumbs firmly onto bottom and up sides of dish.</li> 
                    <li>Bake crust until fragrant and edges just start to take on color, 20&ndash;25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool.</li>
                    <li>Stir gelatin, cinnamon, nutmeg, a scant ½ cup sugar, and ½ tsp. salt in a small saucepan. Whisk egg yolks and milk in a small bowl to combine, then whisk into sugar mixture.</li>
                    <li>Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until mixture begins to thicken and coats the back of a spoon (but do not let it boil), about 5 minutes. Stir in pumpkin purée and remove from heat. Transfer to a large bowl and chill until cool, about 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat egg whites in a large bowl until soft peaks form. With the motor running, gradually add a scant ¼ cup sugar and continue to beat until stiff peaks form, 5&ndash;7 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Mix one-third of egg white mixture into chilled pumpkin mixture until smooth. Gently fold remaining egg white mixture into pumpkin mixture in 2 additions until incorporated, but don&#8217;t overmix.</li>
                    <li>Pour filling into graham cracker crust; smooth top. Cover and chill overnight.</li>
                    <li>Vigorously whisk cream in a large bowl until medium peaks form. Fold in sour cream and remaining 2 Tbsp. sugar and ¼ tsp. salt just to combine. If the cream looks like it could use another whisk or two to hold medium peaks, give it a whisk until it reaches the desired consistency.</li>
                    <li>Using a large spoon, dollop a generous amount of whipped cream in the center of pie. Sprinkle with reserved graham cracker crumbs. Slice and serve with any remaining whipped cream alongside.</li>
