        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Pumpkin bread is an easy fall staple&mdash;with or without chocolate chips.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>219g all purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon ground all-spice</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
                <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>100g granulated sugar</li>
                <li>150g dark brown sugar</li>
                <li>340g pumpkin puree</li>
                <li>1/2 cup canola oil</li>
                <li>1/4 milk or orange juice</li>
                <li>120g semi-sweet chocolate chips (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a metal 9x5 loaf pan with non-stick spray. Set aside for now.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, all-spice, cloves, ginger, and salt together until combined. Set aside for now.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whisk eggs, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together until combined. Whisk in the pumpkin puree, oil, and milk or orange juice.</li>
                <li>Pour these wet ingridients into the dry ingredients and gently mix together using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. There will be a few lumps: do not overmix.</li>
                <li>Gently fold in chocolate chips, if including.</li>
                <li>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake for 60-65 minutes, making sure to loosely cover the bread with aluminum foil halfway to prevent the top from getting too brown. The bread is down when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean with only a few crumbs.</li>
                <li>Allow bread to cool completely in the pan on a wirerack before removing and slicing.</li>
                <li>Cover and store leftover pumpkin bread at room temperature for up to 3-4 days or in the refrigerator for up to a week.</li>
            </ol>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Make ahead tip: baked pumpkin break can be frozen for up to three months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before serving.</li>
                <li>Blot your pumpkin puree: whether canned or fresh, pumpkin puree has a lot of liquid content. In order to make a non-soggy loaf, measure your puree into a small bowl and blot with a paper towel gently to remove moisture before adding to batter.</li>
            </ol>
